# Design grid

## Setting up design grid implementation

The `grid.css` file contains the reusable classes (also called utility classes) that we can use to size our containers in order to create a layout.

This example uses CSS Grid to implement a design grid in this example. Keep in mind, this is just one simple (and incomplete) implementation. In addition, one could use other ways to implement a design grid in code, for example floats or flexbox.

## Using the design grid implementation

The `index.css` contains the work in progress layout that is using the design grid utility classes.
